My first repository showcases a project I did for school.

For my School-Based Assessment, I chose to computerize the student attendance register used at Antigua State College. While attending classes, teachers had to manually check and calculate each student's attendance in a handwritten register, which is very time-consuming and cumbersome. It is also costly, meaning that the school would have to pay a great deal of money for papers and printing. This method of manual checking can easily be misplaced, destroyed, and prone to human error compared to if it was computerized. I also made a feature that incorporates the schools's rule that states, students need an attendance of eighty per cent for all courses. This attendance may also be a determining factor if students have to redo a course or a school year.
